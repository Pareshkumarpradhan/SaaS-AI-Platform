# Learning Goals

Try to understand the following concepts:

- What is a class?
- What is an object?
- what is a method?

## What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It tells computer how to create an object of that type. A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class

__Class is a manufacturer of objects to do a particular job._

We define this as a template.

## What is an object?
An object is  an instance of a class. It is a concrete 'thing' that is made using a class. An object has properties and methods. Almost everything in python is an object, including strings, lists, dictonaries, and numbers.

When we create an object, we say that we are instantiating a class

## What is a method?
A method is a function that is defined inside a class. It is used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Methods are essential in encapsulation concept of the OOp paradigm. This is essential in dividing responsibilities, especially in large applications.
